# Book Repository
[Book Repository on Heroku](https://book-repository-virtual.herokuapp.com/)

"A safe virtual repository for books, a digital version of your library that is searchable, and where you can share your book notes and thoughts with like-minded readers." - Gaff

The Book Repository is a digital or virtual library to store information about your books, such as title, author, year published, ISBN, genre, rating, description, and your reflection and comments.

The Book Repository provides a private and public search function too, using any combination of title, author, ISBN, genre, and rating.

An Admin Dashboard provides user management, loading of genres and books, as well as Book Repository statistics.

### Acknowledgements

The Diploma in Full Stack Development provides a great foundation of tools and technologies used to work as a professional developer. It's a case of being a Jack-of-All-Trades, and a Master of None (or Some). It's up to each developer to expand upon the knowledge and skills acquired during the course through additional self-study of elements covered as a part of the course as well as other frameworks, languages, tools, methodologies,  processes, and solutions.

Thank you Code Institute for allowing me on this journey in life!

Thank you Spencer Barriball for your unwavering support!
